Overview

![alt text](examples/dataset-images.png)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow and python 3.5. The network was based on the LeNet-5 architecture and uses the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) to train and classify road signs (download bellow).
